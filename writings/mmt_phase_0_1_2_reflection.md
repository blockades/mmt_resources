**Disclaimer**: this is obviously all my perspective on things. If you feel you may have been mis-quoted, or that I might have mis-read or mis-understood something then please let me know (privately or in the comments). Once I have a complete draft I am then hoping to get folks read it to see if I missed anything noteworthy.

Although I have sought input on drafts of this post from people all mistakes and errors are my own.

This will take about 20 minutes to read, so I suggest you grab a beer or a cup of tea before settling in.

## Introduction

What happens when you get super excited about a project and then get as many of your favourite, talented, awe-inspiring people into one space as you can?

This Reflection piece is my attempt to refocus MMT and to try to clear up much of the confusion which I have inadvertently initiated upon establishing MMT Loomio. It breaks down the journey into three main Phases; Phase 0: pre-Loomio, Phase 1 Loomio establishment, through till now moving into Phase 2. Taking on board many hours worth of peer review I hope to clarify the concurrent existence of two projects and two groups which have been within MMT Loomio but which at times have been confusingly conflated (most often by me). I am going to talk about mistakes I have made. I am going to talk about Race and I am going to talk about Gender. I am going to talk about how I gathered a 100% male team of programmers and left the work of surfacing much of this insight to those folks generally marked as diverse, repeating shitty dynamics of invisibilised [Emotional Labor](https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/modest-proposal-fair-trade-emotional-labor-economy/centered-disabled-femme-color-working). 

I conclude with a proposal that we take the transition from Phase 1 -> Phase 2 as an opportunity for reflection and to recamp and figure out what it means to be two groups with a confusing, chaotic shared history and ask some questions about what would be needed for these two groups for forge an alliance or further relation.

I apologise in advance if this gets uncomfortable. I hope you all know me well enough to know that this is communicated in good faith. I am not trying to target any individuals or group. I am taking responsibility for getting us to the point that we are at and am taking the opportunity to hold myself to account for the implicit racist and sexist tendencies which I have reperpetuated as time has gone on within the project of MMT. My hope is that calling myself out on this it can open a space for reflection that might mean such tendencies are tempered moving forward.

## Centering my reperpetuation of mainstream bullshit racism and sexism

As we flow through the streams of Phases 0 -> Phase 1 -> Phase 2 I am going to highlight the composition of participants. There is a worrying trend which emerges, primarily under my guidance, where the group becomes less diverse (in terms of race, gender, neurodiversity, different abilities etc) over the course of the project. There is ALOT of material out there about how this happens in so many fields, from [academia](https://www.google.com/search?q=less+women+in+high+academic+positons&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b) to [STEM](https://www.google.com/search?q=less+women+in+STEM&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-b) to you name it. If MMT is to be a liberatory project in any meaningful sense of the word then these patterns really need to be analysed. This article sums it up:

## Phase 0

Following are the four streams of Phase 0; [`A`], [`B`], [`C`] and [`D`].

### __Stream [`A`] (Crypto On boarding)__

This stream started as a proposition. Can I teach my friends about blockchain and cryptocurrencies?

I concocted a half baked plan and started by initially approaching 2-10 friends and then quickly expanding to 30-50 friends to loan them some crypto. The proposition was that if there was appreciation in the loaned crypto they could pay off the loan. If there was no appreciation then I would cancel the loan and call it quits. Essentially I took on the risk of ‘total loss’ and allowed friends to leverage the potential rewards.

In general the very reasonable response(s) to this were in the region of; 'is it April Fools day', 'are you high', 'what are you talking about'. Once folks became slightly more open to the idea that I was being serious the most common secondary set of concerns were around bringing money into friendship; 'it feels kind of strange', 'I'd struggle with feeling indebted to you', 'what if it really does collapse', 'I don't like owing friends money'. Another category of concern was around exploitation; 'who's getting fucked in the process', 'are all cryptocurrencies as devastating to the environment as Bitcoin'. Only after all the needed conversations had been had did we start speaking about how it might work. That space of built trust was an essential ingredient.

Really, then, this stream started as many tributaries of conversational flows of call and response with enough space and care given for people (and me) to begin to feel their way into the complexity. Much of this was the required groundwork needed for me to be able to loan friends some crypto in the first place.

A breakdown of the wider group (about 50) is as follows:

__**By 'occupation':**__

academics, tattooist, bicycle mechanic, ngo-aid-worker, social worker, it professional, teachers, ex-teachers, artists, receptionist, full-time parents, single-mothers, single-fathers, grandmothers, grandfathers, architect, unemployed, health-benefits, sound-designers, therapist, old-age-care, students, film makers, mechanic, midwife, medics

By 'age':

~ 20ish - 70ish

By LGQTI : CIS:

~ 25 : 75

By Male : Female (in so far as this is a useful binary)

~ 55 : 45

By BIPOC : Caucasian

~ 25 : 75

As far as tech projects involving cryptocurrencies go the demographics of the group was fairly diverse. Always room for improvement, but a good starting point.

It wasn't clear to me then, but it is much clearer to me now, that when dealing with 'crypto' we're actually dealing with an emotional and psychological space; one which is potent, loaded, complex, often difficult and quite often unsettling and which effects us all in different ways along the inter-sectional axes of gender, class, race, age to name a few. I'd go so far as to say that everyone struggled with this in some way to varying degrees.

Loaning some crypto to the folks I approached required developing quite a complex spreadsheet (an anonymised version of which you can see [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rUBTZYttsveSoHtYzxY1mSJznO62q89540jinY3hZac/edit?usp=sharing)). Within the first month of on-boarding folks there was a major up-tick in [NEO](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neo/#charts) which meant the value of the pot exploded beyond what I was comfortable with. This meant figuring out how to up-skill everyone so that they could manage their own private keys and get off my spreadsheet (which by this point was making my eyes water).

---

### Observation

_It has not been made clear enough that getting people managing their own private keys is/should be a primary design aim and mission._

---

### __Stream [`B`] (Crypto Workshops)__

During the course of [`A`] (Crypto On boarding) I'd been having many more conversations with folks about what was happening. About 10 or so workshops were organised one of the main aims of which was to help get folks managing their own private keys securely. About 30-40 people attended these workshops.

There was a theoretical attempt on my part to try to co-run these events with help from others, but due to lack of planning on my part and also by not engaging with people in preparation work, I ended up running the show. There were some points where the number of teachers in the group outnumbered those without teaching experience (myself included!), this experience and expertise was not consulted or included in the planning of the workshop.

A review of those sessions is not the primary aim of this reflection, so I will say - it was a learning experience. I've written about some of the workshops on [patchwork](https://viewer.scuttlebot.io/%25Vxdim9E7D8JHERHKLc6T0qMHcd2Bw9cG58Mb8Z0xpdQ%3D.sha256).

In general the participants across all of the workshops were fairly diverse. I only noted down the breakdown of the first workshop but feel it was pretty representative of the demographics of the rest of the workshops:

> It was about 45:55 women:men and about 25:75 #BIPOC : #Caucasian , about 25:75 #LGBQTI : #cis

---

### Observation

_This was an early instance of a trend, on my part, to attempt to co-organise but without properly considering how co-organising **actually** happens (see the current [planning](https://www.loomio.org/d/S7cOGrwh/-event-afrotech-fest-26th-27th-january-2018) for the [Afrotech Fest](https://www.afrotechfest.co.uk/) workshop for an example of excellent participatory workshop planning). To be honest, this has been a theme throughout all phases of MMT and something which I need to work on after a period of reflection about why I have been repeating the same mistakes through several iterations._

---

### __Stream [`C`] (Political Project)__

During this period I was having lots of conversations with @bleep and @johnnyennioaneopto about the political potential of such work. Both @bleep and @johnnyennioaneopto co-ran sessions, as well as participating in an on-going focused working group with me.

We were animated by the following provocations (and many more); would it be possible to teach these skills to people crossing boarders and arriving into countries as they seek asylum. This was the back drop of all the sessions that were run. How could this translate? Could it? It is also at this point that we started to consider that there might be a further political project which could emerge from this work. As complex and tricky a terrain as cryptocurrencies are, we had the gut feeling that this glitch in the system perhaps afforded a rare opportunity to open up spaces for people who might not otherwise have access to the resources to do so. The unreconciled thorn was whether it's possible to transform resources of a destructive nature (see current Bitcoin resource use) into something generative.  

It is this conversation which has, in my opinion, primarily informed the current / theme / thread of redistribution. In a more primitive sense it could also be said that the half baked plan of loaning to friends has also been a basic form of redistribution which also reappears as a theme.

---

### Observation

_The primary reason for taking MMT forward was this perceived political potential. However, the process which I have instigated has led to a situation where the political orientation of the project / potential of the project has often been in the background (rather than front and centre). This lack of leadership on my part, of clarity or of a stated vision has also meant that the process itself has not been sensitive to the realities of embarking on a political project, in common. I'll come back to this in the conclusions._

---

### __Stream [`D`] (Software Project)__

So, back to the complex [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rUBTZYttsveSoHtYzxY1mSJznO62q89540jinY3hZac/edit?usp=sharing), and the beginning of my building of an all male development team. As will become apparent as this Reflection proceeds I gather coding friends I have made along the way, all of whom end up being white guys. Don't get me wrong, I love my friends, all of whome I consider to be excellent human beings - but I have to ask myself why this is. If we don't ask these questions we will continue to recreate the systems, structures and setups which ultimately keep all of us down, but especially those at the margins.   

Concurrent to [`A`] (Crypto On boarding), [`B`] (Crypto Workshops) and [`C`] (Political Project) I started discussing with @kyphae and @nikolai2 about building some software to help automate some of the complexity of the spreadsheet. We consulted with @dave24, who has more enterprise experience with this type of thing, and came away with the notion that 'we could do this', whatever 'this' was. After some more discussion with @kyphae, we arranged for him to work full-time on the project being hired as a subcontractor by my company [Digital Blockades Ltd](http://blockades.org) (DBL).

@kyphae and myself had about 20 hours worth of design meetings where we mapped out some high level overviews of what the architecture for a spreadsheet replacement (with some extra bells and whistles) might look like. This happened over three main days with a gap of about 3-4 weeks. In the first session the scope was expansive. By the second session the scope became simplified and achievable. In the third session we presented to @dave24 with @nikolai2 skyping in.

The output from those sessions can be found in the [User Stories](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KynLagQl3uzlJg-wnBc5dB18ojo5kEKQ1kvttCn0Cyo/edit?usp=sharing) and the [pre-meeting notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EFZxobFBYNRK4oBVhKkGBlzRK5oeUaFXkeVa14PWUN4/edit?usp=sharing)

@kyphae quit his job and then got started on the code. @nikolai2 was contributing adhoc outside of work and child care hours. @ameba23 started to read through the code which started to be produced asking clarifying questions.

It is worth noting that this project was completely conceived at the time as standalone with a primary view to automating and simplifying the spreadsheet. At this time it was unclear how such a project might evolve, but that there was groundwork that could be done together to get the process started. There was some notion that the software might aid with sessions such as with [`B`] (Crypto Workshops). There was also some notion that an organisation might ultimately run the software as a service but it was still unclear how or if this might relate to [`C`] (Political Project).

---

### Observation

_There has been no real relationship between [`C`] (Political Project) and [`D`] (Software Project) other than through both having a connection to [`A`] (Crypto On boarding) and [`B`] (Crypto Workshops) and primarily through me. I have noticed that this has understandably caused a lot of confusion for folks in Loomio. Although much clearer now, I have to admit that this distinction was not clear enough in my head when setting up the Loomio._

_It is also worth noting that upon creation of the Loomio group there was already a distinct divide between [`C`] (Political Project) and [`D`] (Software Project), one which has mostly persisted up till this point. This divide actually makes a lot of sense. [`C`] (Political Project) by this point was a political seedling, needing space, time, care and nurture to grow whereas [`D`] (Software Project) had an existing template (the spreadsheet) from which to work from, so required implementation details and energies and execution._

_Lastly this was the beginnings of what would become a gendered and racialised disparity between the demographics of [`C`] (generally a group of bods who the straight white world would mark as diverse) and [`D`] (an all male 80% white team of programmers) _

_I will come back to this in my conclusions._

---

---

### Recap

_4 streams_

- [`A`]: friends into cryptocurrencies
- [`B`]: running workshops to get people onto their own private keys
- [`C`]: starting to hatch a plan for a proto-political-project with @bleep and @johnnyennioaneopto
- [`D`]: starting to build software to automate the spreadsheet

_2 separate projects_

- a political project ([`C`])
- a software project ([`D`])

The relationship between these two was not yet defined.

Up until this point most all of the organising for the four streams was happening in London and was happening face to face, with about 15% of it happening over the internet. This time spent having person to person skill shares and deep conversations was integral to the seedling of an idea that there might be a potential political project in this work. The face to face meetings were also integral to the ideation phase of planning the spreadsheet replacing software.

It was all happening in the lead up to a time of flux with some folks moving to Athens, me moving to Australia and then to Fiji. I had spoken with a number of people about the prospect of joining an online organising / discussion space where we could figure out the next steps together.

---

## Phase 1

### __The beginning__

On 10th October I set up the [MMT Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/d/wPuTNQmL/reflection-and-review-on-phase-0-1-of-mmt) Group. The initial people invited by me to the group were participants of [`B`] (Crypto Workshops), folks from [`C`] (Political Project) and folks from [`D`] (Software Project). Throughout October, November, December more people were added (mostly by me), though a handful have been added by other participants of MMT Loomio. The loose requirement being that this person be interested in a project like this (whatever that meant). If there is one thing which has unified all participants of the Loomio so far it is that it is a space which has caused more confusion, not less.

It is worth really emphasising that it is really exciting to have had the people in the MMT Loomio that we do. Each and every person in the MMT Loomio rocks at what they do and I am genuinely excited about that each and every day - but without clarity, an awesome collection of people hanging out in an online space doesn't nessecarily serve those people nor any wider purpose - and actually risks wasting the valuable time of the collective energy.

In the beginning the group demographic looked something like this:

- 9 F : 9 M
- 8 BIPOC : 10 Caucasian
- 5 LGBQTI : 13 Cis

Similarly to the composition of the workshops this is not a bad start (though of course lots of room for improvement). Over the next months I would then mostly add more and more male developer friends without much consideration for how this might effect the dynamics of the establishing group.

---

### Observation

_Rather than initially calling MMT Loomio an organising space, it would have been more accurate to call it a discovery and discussion forum._

_In many cases when inviting folks into the Loomio I described it as an organising space for MMT. By doing so there was then understandable confusion at the lack of a clearly stated vision, clear leadership or a clearly defined group of participants. This dissonance was highlighted as new people were invited into the MMT Loomio which added to the existing lack of cohesion within the group (which makes total sense given I had essentially brought two separate groups of people into one space without much a clear explanation)._

---

I opened one of the first threads in MMT Loomio, [Founders of the workers coop](https://www.loomio.org/d/kO3LiMcD/founders-of-the-workers-coop), with the following:

> “Once the software has been built, it has been proposed that the software is run by a coop of some sort. You are all here as potential 'founders' of this coop.”

I feel that this highlights my confusion at the time and also in my opinion laid the foundations for a divide between [`C`] (Political Project) and [`D`] (Software Project). By framing the project as [`D`] first building software and then [`C`]&Co 'running' the software set up a power imbalance, one I am not sure would be possible to rectify within this framing.

### __The middle__

There were some key early attempts at interventions into the unfolding chaos which I had inadvertently initiated.

@ameba23 made an early craic at trying to clarify the mix of what was happening in [Formulating a description of the project](https://www.loomio.org/d/YfwNlc0W/formulating-a-description-of-the-project). With @ameba23 first having arrived at the project through Grace (Software Project) and the early spreadsheet replacing code which @kyphae and @nikolai2 had been writing many of the questions in this post were focused on implementation details emerging from that project and also pragmatic, legal and organisational details about what would be needed by an organisation to run such software as a service.

Another key early and insightful intervention into the unsustainable foundational framing I had set up was made in @afrosapien 's [ETHICS](https://www.loomio.org/g/7thvYpzd/mmt-communcating-ethics-within-the-software) thread. This thread is worth reading through in full if you haven't done so already as it's clearly written and communicated. If I can summarise this post it would be with the following sketch

> Aren't we putting the cart before the horse? And are we even sure this is the cart that we want this horse to be pulling? And are we sure we're all on the same page about the general direction, purpose and mission of this cart-horse-we gig?

The proposals are worth relaying in full here:

> **Short term:**
> Let's start a discussion here about the ethics of this project: How do we wish to be related to each other (friends? co-workers? comrades? fellows? etc.)? How do we wish to value each other's contributions? What is our relationship to money? How do we wish to use/share any gains (knowledge? money?) from the project? Etc. I hope this preliminary discussion can help inform the discussions happening in other threads, re: governance, legal frameworks, workflow and division of labour, etc.

> **Long term:**
> I would like to see us come together in a series of (ideally) face to face meetings, at least once or twice a year, to discuss the ethics of what we are doing, for as long as this project is existing and under way. I am willing to contribute to the organization of such meetings. Let's discuss how to do that. I hope these meetings will be able to inform our working processes and outcomes.

These suggestions are exactly the type of work needed when embarking on a political project, especially one which is at the seedling phase. This work can't be skipped or rushed if you want to set up a political project which is dealing with [wicked problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem). It is a necessarily slow process to make sure i's are dotted and t's are crossed and no stitches are dropped (a stitch in time, saves nine). In a nutshell raising political consciousness and cohesion amongst a group of people is the needed fertiliser/compost/foundation from which to then conceive, imagine and nurture a 'plan' - though it could be said here that _this process is the work and the point_, rather than producing a 'plan' or some product or output.

In particular the emphasis placed on meeting up face to face to get deep into the ethics is key here. Had hundreds of hours of face to face chats, workshops, late night discussions, working groups, phone calls not happened then MMT would not be a thing to begin with.

By comparison, it is possible to build software without such work on ethics. Much of the software which holds up the internet and much of the software which enables cryptocurrencies to work has been built by people loosely working together through the internet, in many cases without people ever having met physically. In general it is enough for participants to just get along.

Compared to the nessecarily slower temporality of raising political consciousness and cohesion of a group, building software is often very fast paced. Some mantras out of the startup and corporate world are ['move fast and break things'](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/26/move-fast-and-break-things-jonathan-taplin-review-damage-silicon-valley), ['fail fast'](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/fail-fast), ['move fast with stability'](http://mashable.com/2014/04/30/facebooks-new-mantra-move-fast-with-stability/). I am not advocating for this approach, nor saying that it is always the case, nor necessarily that those coding are doing it this way - but I think it is fair to say it is a common tendency, especially amongst those who receive their training out in the startup and corporate world where you wage depends on capitulating to such a philosophy. Breaking such Tendencies takes active work and deliberation and I think it's fair to say this work has not happened within MMT so far.

Examples of other ways of doing things do exist - for example Loomio itself would be a good case study. There are projects out there, which I am peripherally involved in, such as [DECODE](https://www.decodeproject.eu/partners) and D-CENT which do much citizen engagement ethnographic research which then informs the technical design and output through [Dyne.org](https://www.dyne.org/). A recent article which @mixmix shared a recent post from the [DAT Project](https://blog.datproject.org/2017/12/10/dont-ship/) where they decided to NOT ship the code for ethical reasons. I imagine there must be thousands of examples of Ethical considerations emerging within the temporality of coding.

My purpose here is not to put the two ways of working at odds, but rather to highlight that this has been the case. Neither is better or worse than the other, but they are different each with their own possibilities, risks and needs. I intially proposed we attempt to bridge this divide by having a team (myself, @ameba23, @bleep and @lyn4) of 'translators' who ['communicate the ethics of the software'](https://www.loomio.org/g/7thvYpzd/mmt-communcating-ethics-within-the-software) at the time of or AFTER the software has been built. This was a problematic proposition. As @mixmix points out _"We should all be a part of this conversation"_. Not only this we need to ensure that there is a shared space for conversation even to happen. This would have meant either [`D`] (Software Project) or [`C`] (Politcal Project) changing their mode of operation or it would mean both would need to co-create a new space.

This group was my first ham-handed attempt to bridge the two worlds but again ran the risk of cornering ourselves into a repetition where diverse folk come into an all male mostly white space of engineers to do the [Emotional Labor](https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/modest-proposal-fair-trade-emotional-labor-economy/centered-disabled-femme-color-working) of acting as translators. At the very least it would all have been very, very complicated, without people having nessecarily signed up for that _type_ of complicated work.

---

### Observation

_By this point those involved in the software were getting into a groove of producing and peer reviewing the code being written. Given the framing and dependency of the Political Project on the Software Project, this groove has been jarring for many not deep in the code. The difference in temporalities has been a site of under the surface and private friction / public confusion - very justifiably._

_Another side effect of the framing of the Political Project dependent on the Software Project has been that focus has been placed on the production of software perhaps at the expense of the needed slowness of raising political consciousness and cohesion of a group - with the result that there were two discrete groups within Loomio MMT._

_It also starts to solidify  the foundations for a toxic dynamic, that no one wants, of the bods marked as generally diverse being dependent on a bunch of generally white guys, even if they are all loved friends of mine. Doing so positioned everyone in a shitty way._ 

_By this point I had added a handful more male friends to the growing coder cohort which would also have been a source of dissonance and incremental breakdown in cohesion of the space._

---

### __The end__

It's worth comparing the composition within MMT Loomio at the beginning and at the end:

At the beginning:
- 9 F : 9 M
- 8 BIPOC : 10 Caucasian
- 5 LGBQTI : 13 Cis

At the end:
- 15 F : 20 M
- 9 BIPOC : 26 Caucasian
- 6 LGBQTI : 29 Cis

Over the course of November and early December I started to approach everyone in the group to see about being funded by DBL and joining part time would enable those with the desire to help take MMT into the next phase.

https://www.loomio.org/d/lZugSmw1/who-else-should-be-in-the-group-?from=10

This was my first attempt at a reflection of the process so far as well as a loose proposal for how to go forward, that is, the creation of a focused group `mmt-subcore`. What was missing from this analysis was the clarity that we are actually two groups operating within the same space, though mostly not _together_ and missed nuance as to the disparity across lines of gender and race. With this clearer perspective then what actually emerged was that the following groupings are now being funded:

[`C`] (Political Project):
- @bleep
- @danhassan
- @johnny
- @kyphae
- @lyn4
- @thecp
- @violet1 (TBC)

[`D`] (Software Project):
- @ameba23
- @danhassan
- @dave24 (opensource adhoc)
- @davidmercer (opensource adhoc)
- @kyphae
- @mattlenz
- @mixmix
- @nikolai2 (opensource adhoc)
- @terevaden4
- @williammoxdrossard

I'd like to reiterate that I am genuinely excited by these two lists of people (and about everyone who has arrived into MMT Loomio). Knowing what I know about each of you, as well as the experiences I have had working with you all on various projects over the years I can't wait to see what we'll do together.

I'm also embarrassed that it has taken me such a long time to reflect on the fact that I have fostered such a lack of diversity in my friendships with fellow coders (please don't take this the wrong way guys!). The problem here is not the friends I have (who are awesome) but that I have spent a decade in tech without having connected with other BIPOC folks and women in the industry. I am guessing this is a part of why we see such structural issues, as patterns such as this get repeated from person to person, and from friendship group to friendship group.

## Conclusions & a Proposal leading into Phase 2

Right out of the gate I would like to make the following proposal:

**I suggest that we fork MMT into two organisations. The Political Project and the Software Project (names just a reference, not suggesting they be permanent).**

Now that we are at the transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2 we have an opportunity to step back and reflect. Taking two groups of people and putting them into the same room does not make them a cohesive group. The experiences up till this point have indicated that in practive we have two groups, for example [developer only meetings](https://www.loomio.org/d/QOvMphz0/developer-meeting-minutes) and most of the work being done within the Political Project happening in parallel via phone calls, messages, checkin’s and face to face meetups. These are a couple of examples hinting at the incommensurability of the different temporalities, needs and approaches of the Political Project and the Software Project.

By not being sensitive to the different needs of the Political Project and the Software Project and by trying to ham-handedly make the two work together in one overarching group I have naively risked hampering both projects (or worse).

If there is any clarity in this reflection it is in no small part due to the dozens of hours of critical peer review which has been fed back through private channels (thank you to all of you, you know who you are) and for which I feel a great debt of gratitude. This clarity hopefully affords us the possibility for an alliance between the Software Project and t (Political Project). Though autonomous, there is a shared history, though chaotic, amongst many of the members of each and some bridges (@danhassan & @Kyphae) between the two. Some hard questions will need feeling through to think about how a political project lead by mostly diverse folks with marginalised folks as their focus might relate to an all male, mostly white coding team.

Some possibilities might be to position the Software Project as rapid prototype development, innovation and experimentation. The Polical Project doing the deep dive on what is needed on the ground. The Software Project's produced modules offering opportunities for review and reflection within the Political Project's processes. The Software Project informed by feedback from the Political Project along bridges. The Political Project informed by experimentation and innovation happening by the Software Project.

What do you think? Do you agree? Do you disagree? Either way I am suggesting we all take a moment to step back and reflect. Check-in with one another and see how this all sits with you. There is alot to reflect on. If you do agree we are two groups then each group probably needs to figure out:

- What is the relationship between the Political Project and the Software Project?
- What is the format for moving forward from here.

Fin. If you have gotten this far - thank you for those minutes of your life. If this has been useful, great! If not, lets add it to the compost heap and figure out what next.
