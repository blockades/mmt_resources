### Terminal sharing

[GNU Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) is a terminal multiplexer which, among other things, allow multiple users to share the same terminal which can be useful for demonstrating things or helping each other with problems.  See this [multiuser screen documentation](http://aperiodic.net/screen/multiuser).  You can also do this with [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki).

This can be combined with reverse ssh tunnelling (which sounds more complicated than it is) from some common remote server to allow people to access a local machine without worrying about setting up user accounts, forwarding ports, and not having a static IP address.  

So imagine i cannot manage to install our latest software project on my local computer and i want help from someone, but i want them to do it in a way that i see what is going on.  If we all have ssh access to a common remote server, I can create a reverse ssh tunnel to it like this: 

`localcomputer$ ssh -R 2000:localhost:22 user@remoteserver`

This will connect to the server as normal, but also open a tunnel so that I can connect back on port 2000 (any port over 1024 should work). 
I can then initiate a named screen session for other users to connect to with 

`screen -d -m -S multisession`

and connect to it myself with:

- `screen -r multisession`
- then do `Ctrl-A :multisession on`
- then do `Ctrl-A :acladd username` for each additional user (these commands can be added to `.screenrc` to save typing them every time)
- `aclchg` can be used instead of `acladd` to use specific permissions eg: readonly (they can see the screen but not type commands)
- Then invite other users to connect with `screen -x username/multiuser` where `username` is the user who initiated the screen session to connect to.
- Then ssh back to localhost effectively taking connected users along... `ssh -p2000 localuser@localhost`
- Another handy tool, [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) can be used to expose a website served on localhost by doing `ngrok http 80` ([see documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs)).  ngrok could also be used as the remote server to expose ssh (`ngrok tcp 22`) but this requires signing up for an ngrok account. 
- Combined with mumble this could be a nice way to fix stuff interactively or demonstrate how to do something
