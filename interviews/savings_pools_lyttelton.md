## Mix's summary / highlights that stood out to me

"It's not about money.... but money is the vehicle"

Our culture and thinking around money is heavily ingrained
  - expect to have to do ongoing education and reflection
  - expect to backslide as a group and as individuals into old ways of thinking

There are different factions / approaches to Savings Pools in NZ, this one was down the very high trust end

Sarah and Brian were happy to make time, and offered more time to help me get set up - savings pools people get generosity and the long game.

Reciprocity
  - Reciprocity- the name for the money you make available on top of the money you pay back.
  - to achieve reciprocity - to have done to paid the reciprocity part of your loan off

Many people in their group tried talking about the Savings Pool to left leaning, values aligned friends:
  - common response is for people to glaze over
  - could be a very small group of people who 'get' the long game here

Some of the best learning the group did was taking on a 'high risk' member
  - really challenged the group to clarify their principles
  - was able to effect really positive change in a person's life

Safety net
  - "what you get by joining this group of people who _will not let you fail_"

Most people think it might be hard deciding who gets to borrow the money, actually the problem is the reverse
  - we need to really focus on helping people think about what is possible
  - we need to support people to unlearn patterns and ASK for money (related to shame etc)

Thinking about what's strategic to invest in:
  - paying off mortgages might not be as effective as paying off credit cards
  - or helping people install photovoltaics

B:
  - would have helped if there was some benevalent donor to get to the $100K level and get into some really interesting spaces
  - the problem is it's a great idea, but it's a bit limited by amount of funding

M: What's been interesting in this neighbourhood for you?

S: here are the basic principles
  - you put in what ou can afford each week
    - no real difference based on what you can afford to put in (more money doesn't make you more important)
  - people propose loans
    - can be quite personal
    - mainly work on trust - this freaks some people out.

  - probably about 20 pools in nz
    - some pools have different philosophies
      - e.g. documentation, contracts, requite collateral
      - we wanted to move away from money as power. de-mysteify. We want to empower people to understand their relationship with money
        - we talked very carefully to start with about these principles and having them aligned
        - we started very structured
        - contracts is just more of the same economic system
      - as we got to  knew each other very intimately after a time
        - we have been trained to not discuss many of these things in western civ
      - we moved away from signed paper
      - peter luten is into signed paperwork. the saving pool in ashburton started working with home loans, so they went more formal
    - we wanted people to not be afraid of their numbers
      - brian would manage the spreadsheets but needed people to understand their accounts

    - we wanted to come at it from a sense of community
      - we started at 9 people, and then went through a large expansion to 20 people
      - 2 years ago when we left we'd done $150K of financing
        - e.g. paying off the end of people mortgages
        - we starting moving people to electric cars and helping people invest in photo-voltaic
        - it was really important to get to know each other, and understand the power money has over people

Mix: tell me about the makeup of your group

S: we didn't loan much in the first month
  - many of us were in lyttelton and didn't need to buy much
  - we had someone with a $8k credit card bill in Australia. he didn't have job to start with, but the credit card company in Aus had offered him a deal about paying off his credit cards for $4k. We decided to give this guy that money and it's made a big difference to his life.

S: we decided we wanted to grow
  - 9 entitites 11-13 people in the group who were very strong
  - we will make sure you don't fail
  - we decided to practice the philosophies and principles we needed to expand beyond people we know and peopl we're comfortable with
  - we had a sponsorship system, but we were pretty loose with that
  - this guy came in his 30s and he's got baggage. When he came, we had a conversation, and some people weren't sure about. We came back to check our principles and see if we needed to change them, or if we needed to challenge ourselves
  - we asked him to come back and talked to him about how this meant he had a group who had his back
    - he started in a new job and after a bit he didn't like it that much
    - we had a conversation to support him to see the longer term pattern
    - this is what I got involved for (S)
    - we think he just needed someone to believe in him and keep him grounded

    - one the challenges was "how do we deal with this guy not having a _feel good_ factor" .. we learnt a lot from this



m: we've had a similar experience with some people in a recent experience in ssbc grants. the question is really "what sort of world do we want to build?"

B: our group was about talking about how we change our dynamic with money

S: we has a requirement like "you have to come to meetings" or you can only miss so many meetings in a row. 
  - there's a girl who used to be able to come but can't so much with her current job
  - we don't actually have hard and fast rules on this

S: I think you should talk to Brian Innes. He's up in Taupo. From a philosphical and consciousness point of view he's the one to talk about. He went over to Sweden and came back and was involved in setting a bunch of this up 
  - I can get his email for you if you like
  - he helped us a bunch
    - he'd help us get our knickers in a twist
    - e.g. don't worry about the savings points (which seemed complicated at the start)

B: you can get started with the discussion with 4-5 people
  - it's about starting to set up a group to come together

S: we have to fly under the radar because of all the legislation
  - we don't want to be part of that so much
  - if you want to come after us feel free

B: money in the bank is taxed, why do you need to pay all this money to have to loan a friend some money?

S: there's this notion of reciprocity. if we take out $5k for our PV setup.
  - Because people give us that opportunity, we pay $5k (the loan), then pay an additional $5k (reciprocity)
  - if you already had $5k in the savings, you could take your 5k out
  - the month after you finish 'paying off' the reciprocity you can take that amount out.
  - 'achieving reciprocity'

S: instead of putting our money in to get interest in the bank, we can loan things to others and save more

B: we got into paying off mortgages, which I think was a bit off-track, because other things have more interest on it (e.g. credit cards)

S: if you want to know the mechanics, let's have another call
S: I started the pool from a conversation we had after the copenhagen meeting where it was evident economy and environmental stuff wasn't goind to change.
  - we wanted to get PV on the roof of every house in Lyttelton (to remove need to damn more rivers)
  - we were thinking about complementary currencies 
  - talked to Helen Dew (can connect you to her - living economies)
    - Helen blew my mind, asked a bunch of excellent questions
    - we hosted a meeting with Helen, hosted her when she was coming to a Green Party meeting, and I put out an ad in the paper
    - we thought you might need to know all the things, turned out we just decided to start in that meeting with Helen

  - when we opened the bank account we had immediately $13K in the bank (which was surprising and exciting)



Mix: do you have any stories about conflict

S: probably the story we've told you already about the guy with some poor credit history. we had a point with a member in our group who was a bit direct with about the situation, and we had to stop and have a reframe
  - facilitator and note taker note rotate these roles
  - we started putting out an agenda before meeting too
  - we definitely had some conversations where I wished we'd stepped in
    - "let's just stop for a moment and think about this"
  - in at least 5 years (started 2009/10)
  - I think the compisition of the group

B: I've had friends I've told friends about this setup and the first thing they say is :
  - "how can you trust people"!
  - THIS is the crux of the thing

S: I would speak with left thinkers, and people would glaze over
  - everyone in our group had this experience
  - it was really interesting

B: it's not necessarily finding like minded people to form a pool with, but it kinda is, because 

M: what's with the living economies website? (it's all about details, and not that much about what's possible, or why people should care)

S: Brian Innes started this movement. There was this crisis with the model because Peter L brought a particular vision. Brian stepped back at some point
B: it's also a fearful conservative view about savings pools because of govt regulation
B: the Swedish Jak Bank thing
  - there were things like this back in Austria after the depression
  - think Swedish thing started again there

S: Margaret and I looked into this Jak Bank, and they put 50% of their time and money in educating about the model
  - have to keep going to the educatin because our filters and culture are so strong around this
  - until we get to a tipping point we would find ourself individually and collectively reverting to our old models

B: Salt Spring Island is another interesting thing to check out

B: if you can just get people talking, this is the biggest thing
  - in some ways it's not even about the money
    - S: it's not about the money

S: you might assume it's hard to decide who get the money
  - people never really asks for things though!
  - we had to peel back peoples thinking about getting them to ASK for money


S: our makeup
  - 3 facilitators : Margaret (living economies, time bank), S, Jacinda
  - max and rowena trying to gift property to the city to grow nut trees

B: It's about community, helping one another

S: it's also about asking "what skills do you have that you can share in the group"
  - e.g. someone had a gate that she needed to fix cos their goat got out, can I borrow $1000
  - brian said "i can build a gate for you"

B: we'll be back in a couple of months, happy to meet up and support you

S: it's not about money but money is the vehicle
