---

just this morning sent to my savings pool
  - think I should resign
  - it's wellington based, and it's a face to face meeting

  - we kept the group to living toom sized (cap 12)

the savings pool was
  - loomio for decisons + record
  - no company
  - started with 11, and only added on person
  - set up a bank account with 2 signatories in group, one outside
    - thought this would be a good safegaurd
    - didn't feel like we needed it as it was a high trust group
    - idea is she would keep an eye on things if anything went weird with the 2

  - person who does points accounting sends monthly summaries for people with money in the pool
    - no good checks and balances
      - e.g. not sure if someone had paid off their loan
      - Charlie Ablett contacted me a year ago saying that someone in their savings pool went through manually and found they had points drift
        - Charlie is a programmer
        - wasn't a big tension in the group, but the accountant was stressed by it
          - this accountant does the accounting for many pools
          - accountant does it on a volunteer basis
          - our group didn't understand why he wanted to manage our thing
          - Peter Luten (not sure of spelling)
          - people in our group found it hard to follow his process


organising the living economoies expo
  - the way pools are given points, you get points for putting money in
  - whether points are loaned out or not does not change whether there's a loan being made
    - not a factor in my group

our accounting system
  - simple, straightfwd from admin perspective
  - e.g. for every point you put in you get a month every for every dollar in
  - not interested in the accounting
    - I'm more interested in the social dynamics and trust
    - couple people really into the nitty gritty agreements
      - e.g. they 1/3 wanted the wording right to support certain values

What babs found useful / interesting
  - just info sharing enabled debt elimination
  - we didn't know what to fund, didn't have a clear loan profile
    - we didn't have the funds to cover mortgages
    - we took on an additional person to find someone to loan to
  - demographics can be really important
    - only did 4 loans over 4 years 

Social dynamics
  - going to these meetings I knew people really well, I would never let anyone in our group go hungry or be homeless
  - it get's quite personal with peoples ability to pay bay
  - I liked that I felt connected to people much beyong the financial transaction
  - we used our email list for other community advice
  - creating much wider resilience, which felt like so much more security

  - I knew one of the people when I started

How the group started
  - community supported agriculture
    - people already doing CSA stuff
    - group invited peter luten to talk
  - babs came along just at the right time
    - we had a circle about what our financial situation was (assets, income)
      - it was quite counter-cultural
    - everyone knew that loans are assessed on their _merits_
      - more about peoples ability to just contribute money

Counter cultural sharing
  - I often don't talk to people about how much money I have in the bank
  - was refreshing to hear people talk about it, and speak matter of factly without shame
  - I felt really priveledged because I was without debt
  - it was quite liberating

Any other conversations that were uncomfortable or surprising?
  - we had someone with a debt situation
    - i learnt about the mechanisms that were possible
  - one time we were discussion about kiwisaver and banks investments in munitions and industry

Each proposal in our group needed collateral

On leaving:
  - at a gardening thing someone invited us to a savings pool in Auckland
  - realised it does feel very place based
    - I no longer felt like I had skin in the game
  - not sure I'll join this pool in Auckland
    - there are 80 people in the group
    - might start a smaller group
    - not as interested in something that feels too transactional

Are these things collected to plant based things?
  - I was at an event called _For the love of bees_
  - there was a person introduced as "being involved with community initiatives"
    - community lands trust
    - auckland anarchists
    - time bank

I was thinking it was crazy that auckland didn't have time bank
  - I was part of the Hutt South timebank (a transition town initiative)
  - I was treasurer of the transition towns initiative, and on [board] of the timebank

  - Lyttelton learning : having a very small prescribed geographic area helps
    - having a density helps people to connect with trading
  - found in HS that a fulltime coordinator over years to make a difference

I was wondering whether it might be good to start where there's already an active community like a church.
  - need to get to critical mass of offers and requests

On remote memebers:
  - depends how tech savy people are

  - in the kitchen of Charles Eisenstein I heard
    - loan less than $10K they approve in Loomio

Mix: I'm interested in people based routing, because I think it's more personal and builds trust as it runs


Mix: any other things I should know about?
  - Living Economies Expo talk was really amazing
  - the Hutt timebanking group start a savings pool with their families
    - David Hannah (wesley community action)


Mix: Tell me a story about


Actions:
  - Babs to send mix agreements
  - Mix call Charlie Ablett (savings pool)
  - Babs to fwd talk by Stephanie
  - Mix send picture


  - Babs: offer to intro mix to people in other savings pools
