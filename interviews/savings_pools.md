# Savings Pools

Savings pools seem aligned with the work and change that MMT wants to see more of.

Mix set out to interview some in New Zealand:
- Babs Lake
- Sarah van der Birch
- Huia Lambert



## Interviews

I'm interested in trying not to assume too much about where the value and learning is.
I want to take an _empathy interview_ approach to surface what was significant for this person / group, and record as much of that story as possible.


### Beginning

- MMT is involved with supporting and growing financial literacy, and community spaces
  - we're running a bunch of experiments around this
  - we also want to learn from others experiences

- The Process:
  - I'm hear to hear stories about your experiences
  - I'll be doing my best not to project my own assumptions in, so I aim to mainly ask questions which I hope draws out more of your story.
  - after this I intend to share reflections from this conversation with the rest of our MMT team.
  - Any questions?
  - consent - are you ok with
    - [ ] being recorded
    - [ ] having your name + groups name associated with this interview
  

### Body

**What would you like to talk about / tell me about?**
  - have you been involved in around finance and community?

**Tell me a story about**
  - how you started as a group
  - what has growth looked like? 
  - how your group has dealt with conflict (e.g. what's the hardest conversation / decision you've had)
  - you have changed as a group
  - what you won't fund
  - a point where your group could have failed but didn't


Ask follow-up questions which follow what feels important to the interviewee. They could be things like

  - why was that so important for you / the group?
    - was it exciting / empowering? do you know why?
    - 
  - how has that changed your perspective?
  - how has it changed your relationships/ your group dynamic?

  - was that different than you expected / hoped?

  - is there anything you'd have done differently if you coul?

## Notes from Chelsea Robinson on interviewing

semi-structured dialogue interviewing
  - letting the person talk
  - not framing their dialogue by how you're asking your questions

  - thematic conversation
    - e.g. introduce what you're interested in, ask what they'd like to talk about
    - perhaps ask supporting questions to drill in to more / less exciting

  - from customer dev labs
    - only ask people about the past, not about the future or present
    - ask people anecdotal questions (tell me a story about...)
    - will surface surprising, but also get people to tell you from their viewpoint


what are the things you want to find out
  - you typically can't just ask that!
  - reframe the questions in order to access some experience
    - e.g. rather than how do I make this thing in the kitchen easier to use, ask what were the steps you went through to make a curry
    - don't ask the interviewee to interpret your research question
