## 1. Setup a Kraken Account

We recommend you setup using KeePassXC or another password manager [(as mentioned above)](#L25).

* Navigate to [https://www.kraken.com](https://www.kraken.com)
* Create an account, setup two factor authentication (either using SMS or we recommend [Authy](https://authy.com/).

We'll need to get you verified up to Tier 2 in order to withdraw fiat currency. Kraken will verify the identity of the user by cross referencing a name with an address.

The required details for Tier 1 & 2 are:
* Full Name
* Date of Birth
* Country of Residence
* Phone Number
* Address

This will enable you to withdraw up to $2000.00 a day, with a monthly withdrawl limit of $20,000.00.

If you need to withdraw more quickly, you'll have to complete the latter stages of verification which will require proof of identity. **This is not necessary for this guide**.

**NOTE:** :warning: Do **not** do this through an anonymising proxy service such as Tor. Kraken will detect this and you will never pass the second stage of verification, meaning you have to recreate a new account. I have not tried using a VPN service such as OpenVPN or ProtonVPN. It may be that these work if you want to add a layer of security.
