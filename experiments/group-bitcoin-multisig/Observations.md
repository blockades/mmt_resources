# Bitcoin Multisignature Experiment

## Observations

### 1. Workflow
* Make sure to have cosigners double-check the destination address, to mitigate loss / mistakes!

### 2. Fees
* Started sending tx's at the lowest network fee. This generally worked and has the lowest loss.
* Fees are relatively small. Small enough for it not really matter much when sending (as we were) over 0.02 BTC.

### 3. Rates
* Rates were set based on an average of the last week's range of fluctuation.
* This will not always be the correct way to do this.

### 4. Async vs Sync

* Synchronous
  - Empowering experience for those involved in paying themselves and others
  - Its actually quite a dry experience, paying wages / accounts isn't exactly the most thrilling of exercises

* Asyncronous
  - Easy and quick, especially with the 'cosigners pool' plugin
  - Transactions can be dealt with at your leisure, therefore possibility of making a mistake is minimised.
