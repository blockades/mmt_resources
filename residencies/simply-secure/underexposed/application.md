# Design Residency 2019 : Underexposed

## What is your project?
>Please describe a design or research project you would like to work on in Berlin. The project may be ongoing and have other sources or support or be something new you are just getting started with.

Dark Crystal is a secret sharing protocol and prototype application. Dark Crystal takes a novel approach to using Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm, combining narrative, human relationships and ritual with new peer-to-peer technologies to achieve distributed secret persistence. A living prototype has been built ontop of the Secure Scuttlebutt stack, a peer-to-peer offline-first gossip protocol, database and mesh network.

We have just been awarded a grant by the Ethereum Foundation as part of their 4th Wave of grants.

On Scuttlebutt, records in a locally stored append-only database are gossiped and replicated between peers across a shared network by up to n degrees of separation. This persistence model makes for immense resilience. Once committed and gossiped, all data, private or public, can be recovered from the mesh without its contents being exposed. In addition, this data can never be deleted.

We posit that this persistence model is transformative when applied to the wicked problem of effective and secure key management. In its prototype form, Dark Crystal extends the Scuttlebutt ecosystem, enabling peers to securely back up secrets (private keys, seeds, passwords and other sensitive information) using the trust in their social network.

Your secret is split into 'shards', encrypted with the relevant Ed25519 keys and sent to selected friends. If your identity becomes compromised, you become locked-out, or lose your secret, your peers can recombine the shards to recover it for you. Whenever you need to regain access, you can request the shard from each custodian, only exposing the original secret once the desired quorum is reached and proof of identity is achieved. Dark Crystal makes this process simple, minimising human error and increasing accessibility. It is a resilient system of collective data ownership.

## How does it relate to the mission of Underexposed?
> https://simplysecure.org/underexposed/

We believe it is possible and important to expand who gets to participate as a peer in peer to peer systems. Building responsible and consentful interfaces is an integral part of our mission.

We believe this social model of data custody has many implications and usecases. First and foremost, when distributing sensitive encrypted information, such as a cache of documents, both the documents themselves and the encrypting key can be 'sharded' and distributed to peers within this unregulated mesh network. 

Distributing sensitive encrypted information, including a cache of files,

It is a critical tool for anyone needing to reliably distribute sensitive information between a small group, anyone at risk of losing their device, and anyone who needs a secure backup for keys or passwords without needing to rely on hardware devices or trusted authorities.

## Tell us about yourself and why you want to do this.
> This residency is an opportunity for both established practitioners and newcomers to the field to work on ethical technology projects. Simply Secure is dedicated to the goal of building a culturally diverse and pluralistic community of practitioners and strongly encourages applications from under-represented people.

Dan Hassan (UK|GUY), is a white-passing descendent of indenture and founder of blockades.org.  A computer engineer active in autonomous co-operatives over the last decade; in areas of economics (Rootstock, Robin Hood Coop, Economic Space Agency, Enspiral), housing (Radical Routes), migration (No Borders) & labour (Footprint Workers Coop). Currently researching blockchains & data analysis for Dyne, Robin Hood Coop & University of Western Sydney | Institute for Culture & Society. Caretaker of Public BigchainDB as part of the IPDB Foundation; Board Member of Robin Hood Coop. A member of dyne.org think &do tank, a non-profit foundation with more than 15 years of expertise in social and technical innovation

Dan started MMT, the team behind Dark Crystal, which is an open source R&D affinity. Composed of cooperative members and activists, MMT have been exploring the potential of new and existing technologies in crypto-space to encourage horizontal group collaboration. Over the last year, we have zeroed in on safe management of private keys as a foundational problem to solve.

Members of our team have built the world's first cooperative hedge fund (Robin Hood Coop), created open source software for collaborative organising and financial decision-making (Loomio and Cobudget), grown networks of next-paradigm social impact startups (Enspiral), participated in a 30 year long federation of cooperatives which has never had a default on a loan (Radical Routes), attracted EU funding for investigations into social currency design and community driven decision making (D-CENT and DECODE), and helped create one of the most vibrant growing ecosystems in cypherspace (Secure Scuttlebutt).

We are all experienced in effective collaboration and know how to work as a team. We are a high-EQ group, emphasising the human elements of what it takes to make great software, backed up by technical expertise.
