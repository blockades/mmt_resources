### simons introduction 

-where is your main home/base?
Stockholm is where I'm based, you'll mainly find me around Europe and sometimes back home in Melbourne.

-how did you get involved with this project?
I know Dan and I'm really keen to learn to code and crypto!
-what has excited you enough to consider being involved in this project?
Super stoked on the learning possibilities and to me the project makes total sense, pooling resources to strengthen networks.

-what skills / experiences do you have which might in some way be connected to mmt.
I'm a Tattooer by day so I'd be stoked to contribute to design projects, also currently learning Ruby in the hopes to be able to contribute more to the build!

-what are some of the main ways you spend time? (this is my attempt at moving beyond the 'what do you do' question). I Tattoo, I draw, I play in a band, I write, I worry, and now i'm trying to learn to tech!

-what groups or projects are you a part of that might be served by something like mmt
I started a community bicycle workshop here in Stockholm before life took over, they could do with some support as the area is being savagely gentrified.

-any other places you'd like to be found on the internet? (twitter etc)
@shiftynewton on both twitter and instagram
### nicolais introduction:
Hey,

I'm based in Leeds (but sadly I work in London). I've been involved in radical tech projects for a while and I've lived (and coded) with Dan. I used to be a mathematician but now I'm a software developer, mainly in ruby (which is currently the main language that mmt is being written in). I'm mainly interested in exciting new software to enable people so I'm focused in making things concrete and with value.
I'm aware I'm in a being in a privileged position and this will be a great project where I can use my technical skills to do something radical and make a positive impact.
I'm a developer and ex-mathematician.

I helped setup a DIY bike repair space in Leeds Pedaller's Arms and still 6 years later I volunteer there, I work for a food tech company where we are aiming to make a market place so farmers are directly connected with their customers, I develop (Cyclescape)[www.cyclescape.org] for Cambridge and London cycle campaigns (also used by a campaign group in the Czech Republic), I work on Propensity to Cycle Tool which is to help councils with cycle infrastructure and I'm helping set up a co-housing project in Leeds ChaCo.
