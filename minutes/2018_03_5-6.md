        - [Experiment Update](https://hackmd.io/JwZgrAHCBsCmYFoBMBjFIEBYAMmBGCwAJgIwCGCEAZkQOywTbSYSzZA=#) :microscope:
            - Proposal 1 (KISS) wages in the open

            - document storage thoughts (offline vs. online)


###  **mix: had another interview with folks mix knows from his past**

- was a very potent conversation (put in ssb)
- realised these were his people
- "by joining you join a group of people who won't let you fail"
- "it's not about money, though we use money"
- "reciprocity" <-- in reference to dynamic created
- has written more details
- suprised that there are a bunch of people who are values aligned and philosophical
- they mentioned empowerment and they tried to have conversations with other lefties - people glaze over and not really getting why you would be playing with money
- other big learning was that the group learned its most when they took on a member that was more 'risky' (bad credit rating), how to hold space for someone who has some poor
- dan: how are the conversations? energising, neutral or draining
- ---> mix found 1st on neutral, second one energising given positive direct action towards furture

### **Mix: has done an update of bitcoin guide**

- moved document from hackmd -> github
  - hackmd was offline, moving to offline first by placing git
  - wiki should point out to mmt-guides
- good documentation takes a lot of time
- learning
  - kieran: don't patronise peoplem, agree with mix that you need to give folks enough context that they understand what they are doing and why
  - assume people are smart!
  - mix: don't be imperative (click here, click here, click here)

### **Dan on experiments**

- have found setup for the experiment has taken time
  - thread that links out to discussions
  - prodding people, keeping it ticking along
- have agreed to KISS
  - going to start with pay
- all the nitty gritty!!!
  - multisig gets paid to mix ... or coop?
    - mix has not talked to piet about being paid in crypto
  - how to I convert money to fiat
  - how do we do multisig async (see guide)
    - mix + alanna are the blocks, this is super async and interesting


### **Ideas for Alanna to work on**

A: the possibility space it pretty broad...
A: I'm fine being told what to do
D: here's some ideas:
  - you're a beginner (to mmt + crypto), which is actually really useful
    - from the guides, what are your thoughts
  - mmt: internal review of our conversation / feedback on process


M: here are some ideas:
1. would be good at **goverance** layers
    - thinking about strategies and lenses
    - what do we care about and making sure we don't slip away from these points
    - internal 'holding to account' person <--- help develop this
2. alanna has lots of experience with **supporting async collaboration**
    - possible she hangs out in #mmt channel on ssb
    

A: here's what I heard (looping back):
- dan: 
  - go through guides as a beginner
  - experiment feedback
- mix:
  - bigger view feedback
  - accountability
  - online engagement in #mmt channel



### **Peg exploration updates**

Anything you're excited about / what did you experiment with?

important in the last week:
- a new password manager:
  - "Pass" or gnuPass
  - keepass is good for teaching people
  - conversation
    - Phonebox: is it compatible with KeePass? P: no

    - D: I'd invite you to write a guide

    - M: would love a guide which is a table of Yes/ No for different password managers
- Peg: should we or should we not share seeds
  - Dan: we'll discuss this on ssb

### **Kieren exploration updates**

- spent a lot of time learning ssb
  - flume db learning
  - mix's exercises
  - engaging with the community
  - made PR to patchwork! (feature which saves drafts)
- cryptonites: 
  - meeting in end of march


mix ideas: 
  - I'd love to get a feature built "who's in the room"
  - build an interface for mutual credit
  - improve gatherings
    - scuttle-gathering
    - index page / filters for gatherings (e.g. show me a "calendar view")
    - add geolocations ?
    - show closed / finished vs open

Alanna: can I facilitate the next meeting?
Dan: yes

### Misc

- kieran: invites everyone to use mix and kieran experiment notes


#### About the password manager question - a suggestion:

If someone is already using a password manager they are awesome and doing a smart thing and should be encouraged to continue doing it rather than told that xyz password manager is 'approved' or 'disapproved' for their wallet keys (and who here is in a position to audit all the password managers forever?)
perhaps they can ask some questions of their current password manager:
is it run by a company that could disappear one day?
if so are your passwords backed up in a secure form you can open with another tool?
is there any way the service you use could read your passwords?
(...more/better questions here)
if you are not completely satisfied that your current password provider is secure (does not have access to your passwords) or that they are long term futureproof (non-proprietary storage or secure back-up format) then consider using keepass instead or as well.
Then people can make an informed choice and not just take someone's word that their password manager is 'good' or 'bad' or feel discouraged from continuing to use something that works well for them in general. 
ie suggest share the criteria primarily and the opinions secondarily. great if we can confirm some other options too as examples without offering a definitive guide that might not get maintained.
getting people to use ANY password manager is sooooo hard, if they are already doing it then they are already heaps better at looking after their passwords than most of the world.

Also - **a note about passwords** - On a quick scan I see the guide suggests using a line from a well known song - many security experts do not recommended this practice or at least suggest adulterating the string in some way with mixed characters - assume there are giant robot monsters out there spitting star wars quotes at your secured data!
