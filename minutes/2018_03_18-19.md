## Agenda Items

* Iterations in how we're working together



**Alanna**: Feels like the meta level of 'how we're working' is taking a lot of focus, when we're still not even sure what we're working on together. Could it be enough just to keep talking to each other without further coordination added on top?

* dan: [A Proposition For Peer Support](%Oqv5KTNo1vhPwGNC1sPSvXCc6XNawtbw+A88b5OtE0E=.sha256)

**Phonebox**: I think talking about feelings and processing is integral to this work. This could bring stuff up for people, which we need ways of dealing with.

**Mix**: My sense is Dan's held a social bridging role thus far, and has felt responsibility for that. Mix and Dan we're doing some one on ones - if he was doing that for everyone it would take lots of time. But do we need that level of support now?

**Alanna**: how about we try pausing developing formal systems and check whether we need them as the need arises.

**Kieran**: I feel like there are people I can talk to, and it's good to hear that people other than Dan are up for that.

**Mix**: Let's add a standing agenda item where we check in on how we're feeling about MMT communications

**Proposal agreed:** :+1: No formal peer support system now, people reach out to each other as needed, standing agenda item to check in on MMT comms.**

---

Reflections on how comms are going:
- kieran: 
  - finding it hard to keep up in patchwork #mmt
  - people didn't give me their btc wallets
- peg:
  - posted a message I didn't get a repo (mmt, after last meeting)
  - unclarity about PR on guides repo
- phonebox:
  - patchbay branch `mmt` delivers just mmt content 
- dan:
  - didn't engage as much as normal
  - still feeling excited about the people, still not sure where we are + where we're going
  -

Fishbowling / Just Listening <-- should we?

- alanna: let's use it sparingly
- mix: ditto
- kieran: i'm think its a good idea, but open to whatever
- phonebox: i'm excited for others to take the mantle I've been holding
- dan: feels like I talk a fair amount in meetings, and my experience just listening was way more interesting than I would have thought

**[Lets Use Loomio Proposal](https://www.loomio.org/p/D8MHbzq2/lets-use-loomio-for-making-decisions)**

Go online to Loomio and read the proposal and vote pls.
	
**Documentation/Wiki - [Mix's recs]**
%QIaDmLHVlmb/Pd8Q4XUSXSAVVfj/ovSmIQTDbnAwA3Y=.sha256

Mix keen for yay's or nay's so this can move forward. Please add comment on SSB thread.

Experiments - quick updates

* **Dan:** thinking about how to report back. Questions and actions have surfaced. Maybe need executive summary. Available as support for shifting funds. Sent Mix's bitcoin guide to my brother and he could follow it.
* **Kieran:** Mix and I did some transactions on the blockchain. Hoping to have a discussion but it didn't happen. Async messages worked OK. Doing more this week.
* **Mix:** Started off by ignoring plugins and using raw interface. Tried to make a mistake but couldn't, as a test. Payment is through. Next time will try plugin. Ran through multi-sig set up for protozoa (my coop) - was easy. Keepass has a large PW generator built-in.

**Transaction map**

Dan: Can see transaction in Electrum, but can't see who compiled it.

Mix: We skipped the "description" field, which we could/should use in the future.

**[Secret Sharding](https://github.com/KGibb8/truename-indexhtml)**

Kieran built little react app to use Horcrux. For reconstructing keys from smaller pieces. Don't need to spin up your own server, so non-technical people can use it.

municipal bonds: thread on SSB, people read and comment pls
