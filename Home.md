Or rather, it is not nearly as crazy as the monetary system we currently rely on. 

* [Frisby, Dominic, Bitcoin - The Future of Money?](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=81336BF1C30AB56903ADE8222898E40F)  A pretty fantastical, and hyping it all up a bit but anyway readable.  He thinks satoshi is nick szabo.

* [Swan, Melanie, 2015 (O'Reilly)- The Blockchain](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=B95D1E4464D572D397F0F60C47553391) Old news now, but this book was what really got me thinking 'this is gonna be big!'

* [Andreas M. Antonopoulos-Mastering Bitcoin. Programming the Open Blockchain-O’Reilly 2017](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=C145F63D1B1DFCAFE4FB668EE1870D43) more recent and a very good technical introduction.
